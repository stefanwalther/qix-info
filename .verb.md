## About

A super simple & minimalistic library & CLI to get some information out of the QIX engine.  
Ideal for some prototyping work.

## Installation

### As a library

```
$ npm install qix-info --save-dev
```

### As a command line tool
```
$ npm install qix-info -g
```

## Usage

### As a library

```js
const QixInfo = require('qix-info');

(async () => {
  let qixInfo = new QixInfo();
  let apps = await qixInfo.listApps();
  console.log(`Amount of apps: ${apps.length}`);
})();
```

### CLI

List all apps:
```
$ qix-info --host localhost:9076 list-apps
```

## Roadmap

I might want to add more functionality over time (e.g. such as the `healthcheck` endpoint, listing extensions, etc.), but only as needed.  

Feel free to extend this library and adding a pull request.
